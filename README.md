## How to use with the iv4xrDemo repository

* Add the EmotionalCritic.java file to the folder lab-recruits-api/src/main/java/emotions
* Add the three .csv maps to the folder lab-recruits-api/src/test/resources/levels
* Add the three .java tests to the folder lab-recruits-api/src/test/java/agents
* Create the folder lab-recruits-api/src/test/resources/emotions
* Run any of the tests using JUnit. A test file with the emotional results will be created.
* Use the emotionalPlots.py program to analise the test file. The tests will be named according to the time they are saved and will be on the "lab-recruits-api/src/test/resources/emotions" folder. The name of the test file will need to be given to the python program for it to read the data. The path of the repository will also need to be given.
